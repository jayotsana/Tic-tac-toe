# Tic-tac-toe
Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
I created this program for practice with coding in the Python language, which I had only recently learned when I created this game. Standard rules apply. 1st player uses the X symbol, second player uses the O symbol. Player order is picked at random position.
